# Scope of Project

E-commerce business is increasing rapidly and it also prompts the logistics business that is responsible for delivering products/mails/documents to customer locations nationwide. The efficiency of filed personnel (people who deliver goods to customers’ locations) and customer satisfaction are vital for any logistics company. 

The purpose of this project is to increase the field people’s working efficiency, the efficiency of delivery, and reduce the errors made by human inputs, etc.

This system will be a Package Delivery Application System which aims to facilitate the process between the online shop (e.g. Taobao.com), the logistics companies and the customers. 

This system will be designed to maximize efficiency of packages delivering and the customers' user experience, by providing tools for customers to finish the buying process with ease and filed personnel (i.e. postman) to schedule their work. 

This system covers the pre-shipping process, shipping process and post-purchase process. It take cares of user's need from choosing the paying agency to deal with changing and refunding. During the whole delivery process, the customer is expectation will be always getting feedback for their request as soon as possible, so the mission of this system is to help customers and resolve potential or existing issues.

More specifically, the system is designed to allow customers to place order, pay for the goods, and communicate with the filed personnel in the process of delivering if needed. The system will facilitate communications between customer and the filed personnel by Web App or text messages. 

Customers are allowed to experice the uniformed yet very personalized process online and also offline. For example, the system will be smart enough to reduce the customer's count of operations by providing stragedies like using GPS to locate the customer's position, which may help to improve the efficiency.

The text messaging sub-system is one of the most important parts of the system. The system may notify customers or prompt for customers' choice on the fly, which is very efficient because customers are not supposed to be required to login the system and get things informed.

The user interface of the system is fully responsive. i.e, the web page is mobile optimized and can be accessed easily. No matter where the customer is, if he/she have a modern smart phone and internet access, then he/she can perform as many operations as on the PC side.
