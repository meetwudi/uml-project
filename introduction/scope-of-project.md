# Scope of Project

This system will be a Package Delivery Application System which aims to facilitate the process between the online shop (e.g. Taobao.com), the logistics companies and the customers. 

This system will be designed to maximize efficiency of packages delivering and the customers' user experience, by providing tools for customers to finish the buying process with ease and filed personnel (i.e. postman) to schedule their work. 

More specifically, the system is designed to allow customers to place order, pay for the goods, and communicate with the filed personnel in the process of delivering if needed. The system will facilitate communications between customer and the filed personnel by Web App or text messages. 

Customers are allowed to experice the uniformed yet very personalized process online and also offline. For example, the system will be smart enough to reduce the customer's count of operations by providing stragedies like using GPS to locate the customer's position, which may help to improve the efficiency.

The text messaging sub-system is one of the most important parts of the system.
